          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. 
          <li>The title element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>A ul element declares how large the font should be and the padding.</li>
          <li> Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property </li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "enter a commit message that describes what the commit contains" is a git command that commits changes.</li>
          <li> git pull origin main is a git pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment.</li>
	        <li>The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work. Otherwise, you might be working on outdated code!.</li>
          <li>git push origin local github branch is a git command push to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all. </li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
          <li>Typically JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom. However, using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A for loop is used to iterate over the array so that the block of code will be iterated over or repeated.</li>
